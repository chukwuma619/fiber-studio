# Fiber Studio

Native desktop app for the [Fiber Network](https://www.fiber.world/docs) on [Nervos CKB](https://nervos.org). Fiber Studio wraps the official [Fiber Network Node (`fnn`)](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber) so you can run channels, send and receive payments, and manage your node without living in a terminal.

Built with [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app/start/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

> **Status:** Early development. This repo is the ground-up v1 rebuild. The earlier prototype lives at [chukwuma619/fiber-desktop](https://github.com/chukwuma619/fiber-desktop).

## What Fiber Studio is

Fiber is CKB’s peer-to-peer payment and swap layer — channels, routing, invoices, and fast off-chain value movement. To use it, you run **fnn**, the official Fiber Network Node.

Fiber Studio does not replace `fnn` or fork the protocol. It is the interface for the same official node: install and run `fnn` locally, with guided setup and task-based flows instead of CLI-only workflows. Your CKB key file stays on disk; secrets stay in the OS keychain. It is not a hosted wallet.

## Planned features

- **Guided setup** — network, data directory, config, and CKB key file
- **Node lifecycle** — start, stop, logs, and recovery when the node outlives the app
- **Wallet** — send and receive payments, human-readable amounts, invoice QR codes
- **Channels** — open, list, and monitor channels
- **Network** — peer management, connectivity, and network visibility
- **Local-first security** — `fnn` runs on your machine; keys never leave your device

## Prerequisites

Install [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS:

- System dependencies for your platform
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or Node.js **20.19+** / **22.12+**)
- On Windows, use **Git Bash** for the commands below

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chukwuma619/fiber-studio.git
cd fiber-studio
bun install
bun run fetch-fnn    # download bundled fnn sidecar for your platform (required once)
bun run tauri dev
```

Fiber Studio bundles the official [fnn](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber) binary (currently v0.8.1) as a Tauri sidecar. The `fetch-fnn` script downloads it from GitHub Releases into `src-tauri/binaries/` (gitignored). Run it before `tauri dev` or `tauri build`.

Other scripts:

```bash
bun run dev          # frontend only (Vite)
bun run build        # production frontend build
bun run fetch-fnn    # download fnn sidecar for current platform
bun run tauri build  # production installers → src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```
